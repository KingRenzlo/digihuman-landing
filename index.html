## 💡 The Digi.Human Advantage

Unlike bloated pipelines with dozens of textures, broken UVs, and locked-in body parts, Digi.Human uses a single shared UV layout for all characters — across gender, style, and even species.

This means:

✅ One Swap = Full Face, Genitals, Nails, Makeup, Scars
✅ Zero need to rebake, rewrap, or rebuild anything
✅ Every texture is a modular skin layer (not just color)
✅ Tattoo-ready UV zones keep consistency across swappable designs
✅ Perfect for runtime character customization or modding

→ You don’t replace the character. **You reskin its soul.**

## 💡 Core Technical Superiority: One Material, One Skeleton, Universal Compatibility

**Digi.Human isn’t just modular — it’s unified.**

### 🧠 Single Material Instance

* Every character uses one master material, driven by dynamic material layers and switchable textures
* Supports makeup, tattoos, dirt, scars, and custom skin — no shader rebuilds
* Streamlined for LODs and performance — no material bloat

### 🦴 Single Skeleton Across All Characters

* Every character — no matter the body type, species, or gender — uses the same skeleton
* One animation blueprint. One set of animations. One retarget setup
* Plug-and-play with Unreal’s animation systems (IK, motion matching, control rigs)

### 🎮 Works in One Blueprint Framework

* Full integration across morph targets, ARKit, JCMs, clothing sockets, physics, and UI
* No per-character rework
* Characters are truly instanced, not individually rigged Frankenstein meshes

---

## 🧨 Supercharge Uniqueness with 3D TNT

*(3D Tattoos & Textures)*

**Digi.Human is the engine.**
**3D TNT is the ammo.**

### 🖊️ Overlay-Ready UV Zones

* Characters are pre-mapped for ink, scars, paint, branding, blood, etc.
* Tattoo zones baked into the UVs — no need for decals, no seams, no warping

### 🧬 Hot-Swap Identity

* Instantly transform characters with a single texture set:

  * New skin tone
  * New face markings
  * New species
* No need to rebake normals or retarget anything

### 📦 Tons of Packs

* Get hundreds of overlays:

  * Tribal ink, military tattoos, fantasy brands, biomech skins, ritual paints, scars, wounds, freckles, makeup sets, occult sigils
* Organized by style, tone, and region

### 🛠️ Creator-Ready

* Load your own tattoos into the system
* Use your brand’s markings — or your community’s

### 🎯 One Material, One Mesh, One Skeleton

* Every character, every tattoo, every look — same system
* Ultra-performant. Built to scale. Game-ready.

* Pass final approval testing

### 💰 Revenue Breakdown:

💵 Creators keep 100% on all asset sales
